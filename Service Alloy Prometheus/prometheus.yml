  # FastAPI metrics are now scraped by Alloy and pushed via remote write
  # No need for direct scraping here

# Note: Metrics from FastAPI service are now received via Alloy remote write
# The remote write receiver is enabled via the Docker command flag:
# --web.enable-remote-write-receiver
# Alloy will push metrics here via the remote write protocol at:
# http://prometheus:9090/api/v1/write
